              About me
            </h3>
            <p>
              I'm a student and an open-source contributor.<br />
              I study Mathematical Engineering at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/" className="hover:text-teal-400 hover:font-semibold underline">Politecnico di Milano</a>.<br />
              I love Maths and Computer Science - they're about the same things: solving problems, optimizing processes and finding creative ways to achieve your goals.<br />
              Maths is fascinating: you can find it everywhere, and it is so good at explaining most - if not all - things.<br />
              Programming is a tool that lets you solve any problem you can think of.<br />
              I first approached programming four years ago using Arduino to create simple devices. I immediately loved it: it's hard to describe the joy of seeing that what you've been composing for so long actually works! I don't hate bugs - they're like sub-quests you need to complete.<br />
              I'm using mainly C#. After three years of it, I can say that it's not perfect, but I like it as it is.
